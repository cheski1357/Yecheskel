    Deep within the northern Australian lush pastures, the longtime tradition of the
    sheep grazing is embedded in the local culture. The sheep that we use graze on the most nutritious
     wild grass. Our ethical standards of slaughter, and humane standards of treatment of the animals that we
     use, have been  held by our restaraunt for generations,  lies in every dish, and is 
     experienced by all who come to the Sheep's head.
